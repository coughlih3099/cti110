            <p>Magic: the Gathering is the best game ever created</p>
            <p>It was created by 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield">
                Richard Garfield</a> and launched in 1993.</p>
            <p>Magic: The Gathering is a card game. Two players assume the role
            of a "Planeswalker" and battle each other.</p>
            <p>There are a multitude of different ways to play Magic, called 
            formats, but the most popular way to play is a format called
            Commander.</p>
            <p>Commander, unlike other official formats, is four player; each 
            player creates a 100-card, singleton (that means you can only have
            one copy of each non-basic land), and battles in a free-for-all 
            match.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast (the company that runs MTG), 
            hates it's playerbase and doesn't get what it takes to run a digital
            client; so the premier way to play Magic, MTG Arena, doesn't have 
            access to commander</p>
            <p>The Arena analog of Commander is called Brawl which, coincidentally, 
            is the way I play Magic the most</p>
